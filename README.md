# Ash
Ash is built on the assumption that very few people like spam. Generally, that includes people like
the ISP's, domain registrars, and whois-protection services that spammers use to work their websites.

By collecting a database of spammy websites and their technical, administrative, and registrar contacts,
Ash makes it much easier to pull a list of websites and send an email to someone who might be able to
do something about those websites.
